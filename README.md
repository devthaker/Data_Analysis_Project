## Introduction

**Data Set:** WHO Suicide Statistics (URL - https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics)

>**What is it about? How was is collected?**

​

>>The dataset consists of the number of suicides each year in a given country, split by sex and age groups, plus the total population in according group. It is a basic historical (1979-2016) data by country, year and demographic groups. This dataset was created by a verified kaggle user named Szamil. He had collected and created this data  file using the WHO Mortality Database online tool. It was prepared and uploaded without WHO's knowledge, let alone approval or endorsement. Yet, the data itself belongs to WHO. 

​

>**Data Attributes:**

>>1. country - Names of the countries.

>>2. Year - The year of ananlysis. They range from 1979 to 2016

>>3. sex - represents the gender 

>>4. age - represents the age group

>>5. suicide_no - number of suicides commited in a particular country, year, sex and age group

>>6. population - population of that country in the year of analysis

# Discussion

We started our analysis by finding the crude rate of suicides per 100K people in each country in the span from 1979 to 2016. The usage of rates is self-evident, because the sheer number of suicides is proportional to the population size: the larger the country, the more suicides. What's less evident is that these rates, also known as crude rates, make it impossible to compare nations properly. Suicide rates fluctuate greatly based on demographic groupings, as we will see, therefore while looking at a country as a whole, one must consider its existing demographic composition. The highest crude rate was found out to be San Marino's which was 300.75188 in the year 1997 for the age group 75+. Thenafter, to get a detailed insight about the trend, we calculated the total number of suicides based on the gender. After the analysis, the trend that we noticed was that the number of suicides committed by men is approximately 3 times than the number of suicides committed by women, irrespective of the year or century. Furthermore, we disected the suicide rates on the basis of age-group and found out that the highest rate of suicide in the given span was noted in the age-group of 35-54 and the least was found out to be in the age group 5-14. In a nutshell, We can see a directly proportionate relation between age and number of suicides but the fact that "suicides" in general is a social topic which is believed that have numerous affecting factors. As there are unknown variables involved that can affect the number of suicides it would be logically correct for us to believe that age and number of suicides merely have a correlation. It directs out the idea that age is not the cause or rather age is not the only cause behind suicides. 

Moreover, We calculated the suicide rate for each country for the given time span and found out the highest number of suicide rate of the country Lithuania and the lowest for Saint kitts and Nevis. Then we calculates the total number of suicides in 20th and 21st century seperately and compared them seperately. After the analysis, we found out that the suicide rate was higher in the 21st century than that of the 20th century. This might be because of numerous reasons such as increase in competetion, urbanization, etc.

# Conclusion

Overall, the conclusion of the report was conclusive while also opening doors and letting us understand as novice data analysts what more can and needs to be done to a data set to better understand it and be able to convey the information easily to a reader who may not know all the working of the data initially. It was important for us first to understand the data on a deeper level. Aspects such the proportionality of the numbers we were looking at was an important factor to understand before any conclusions were drawn on the topic. When first starting to handle the original data set it would be easy to see that the country with the lowest suicides was Saint Kitts and Nevis, but without context a number is just a number, when further looking into context and finding population size, gender, and geographical location it became clear that without proper formatting the data could not be used to make a conclusion. Regardless overall, we believe the original object of report was met and we gain deeper knowledge of the original data set through the use of skills learned about data analysis. Skills such as data selection, cleaning, organising we an important tool to be able to complete the project with a sense of accomplishment while leaving with a clear idea of ways to improve upon given another iteration
